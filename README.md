## MongoDB Incremental Migrations
Not production code, just a proof of concept. 

Points to be demonstrated:
- what should be done to achieve migration capability without taking database offline?
- what is the overhead (extra object metadata, any slowdown for objects that needn't be migrated)?
- what should be changed on the C# driver?
